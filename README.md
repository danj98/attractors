# Attractor animations

This project generates animations for various mathematical [attractors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attractor). The animations are currently created using Python, Numpy and the Matplotlib library. They should however be rewritten in something faster.

## How to use
1. Clone the repository
2. Run the file for the attractor you want
3. Animations will be saved as a GIF in the output directory

## Requirements
* Numpy
* Matplotlib

## Available attractors
* Halvorsen
